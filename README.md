## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the core implementation
  - `models.py`: Models for submovement detection and reconstruction
  - `data.py`: Dataset implementations for synthetic and organic movement data
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for data processing and evaluation
  - `dataset_reader.py`: Functions for creating STV data from the original datasets.
  - `alternative_detectors.py`: Contains code for the Peak Detector and preliminary version of Scattershot
  - `movement_decompose.py`: The final Scattershot version used

  - `Train.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training the models. It was run in a Google Colab environment.
  - `Analysis - organic and synth.ipynb`: Notebook used to analyse results, run inference for the model and baselines, and generate the figures.

- **configs/**: YAML configuration files for different model variations - pre-training, full fine-tuning, leave-one-dataset-out, ablations
  - Configuration for model architecture, training parameters, and dataset options

- **checkpoints/**: Contains both pre-trained and fine-tuned model checkpoints. Only the fine-tuned checkpoint released under CC BY 4.0 is included here; the checkpoint trained on the hand-writing data (research-only licence) will be linked later.‚Äù
